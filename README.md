# i915-firmware
## Just linux-firmware mirror for i915 users contains minimalist around 46 MB files

I am aiming that everyone can get latest firmware for their old computers without worrying a useless time to clone every linux-firmware

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/naups/i915-firmware
cd i915-firmware && sudo cp -r * /lib/firmware/i915/ # for Ubuntu/Debian derivatives
```

## Disclaimer

This is only a mere mirror but has more utility that folks wants
